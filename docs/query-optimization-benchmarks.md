# Incremental query optimization measurements

These changes build on the shared query IR (`57a94728`). Each optimization has
its own commit, correctness tests, and before/after measurements against the
immediately preceding implementation. Ordinary LINQ and SQL use the query
optimizations automatically.

## Method

`tools/QueryOptimizationBenchmarks` runs complete queries on an in-memory database
of 20,000 documents, with indexes on `_id`, `Score`, and `City`. Every query fully
consumes and checksums its results. Database creation, inserts, indexing, and
warmup are outside timing. Each process records nine batches, elapsed time,
allocated bytes, Gen0 collections, and representative execution plans.

Measurements use production assemblies (`TestingEnabled=false`), .NET 8.0.30 on
Linux x64 / AMD Ryzen 9 3900X, pinned to CPU 2 with tiered compilation disabled.
Two processes per version run sequentially in before/after/after/before order;
tables pool their 18 samples and report medians. These are warm, memory-resident
workloads, not disk throughput claims. Raw data is in
[`benchmarks/query-optimization`](benchmarks/query-optimization).

Build each library revision to a separate output directory, then compile the
same harness against it:

```sh
dotnet build LiteDB/LiteDB.csproj -c Release -f net8.0 -p:TestingEnabled=false -o /tmp/opt-lib
dotnet build tools/QueryOptimizationBenchmarks -c Release -p:LiteDBAssembly=/tmp/opt-lib/LiteDB.dll -o /tmp/opt-bench
DOTNET_TieredCompilation=0 taskset -c 2 dotnet /tmp/opt-bench/QueryOptimizationBenchmarks.dll label or
python3 tools/QueryIrBenchmarks/compare.py --before before-1.json before-2.json --after after-1.json after-2.json
```

The optional final argument filters workload names by prefix; omit it to run
the full suite. An optional third argument scales iterations per batch (for
example, `label boolean-control 10` uses ten times as many). The `or` prefix also includes the `ordinary-*` control queries.

## 1. Equality disjunctions use indexed seeks

`Score == 1234 || Score == 17890` previously scanned all 20,000 documents.
The optimizer recognizes equalities on the same scalar indexed expression and
executes the equivalent IN seeks. It supports nested OR, reversed operands,
parameters, and deterministic expression indexes. Mixed fields/operators and
multikey ANY/ALL predicates retain their existing behavior. Seek values are
ordered and deduplicated using the database collation, preserving index-based
sorting and pagination.

| Complete query | Before µs | After µs | Time reduction | Before B/query | After B/query |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| OR, LINQ | 31,276.40 | 64.82 | 99.8% (483×) | 40,879,384 | 54,254 |
| OR, SQL | 30,322.66 | 63.95 | 99.8% (474×) | 40,882,488 | 57,510 |
| Ordinary primary-key lookup, control | 41.68 | 40.62 | 2.5% | 33,652 | 33,676 |
| Ordinary combined predicate, control | 65.02 | 63.71 | 2.0% | 37,539 | 37,587 |

The large gain comes from replacing a full scan with two seeks. The control
queries have unchanged plans; their small timing differences are not evidence
of a general speedup. Focused disjunction, ordering, and shared-IR tests: 29 passed.

## 2. Intersect scalar index bounds

`Score >= 10000 && Score < 10010` previously scanned from 10000 through 20000,
loading documents to test the upper bound. The optimizer now intersects bounds
on the selected scalar index and removes the filters the bounded scan enforces.
Inclusive/exclusive endpoints, reversed comparisons, redundant bounds, separate
parameter documents, numeric types, and collation are preserved. ANY/ALL ranges
are excluded because separate elements may satisfy their bounds. Backtracking
at an inclusive range endpoint now also uses the database collation.

| Complete query | Before µs | After µs | Time reduction | Before B/query | After B/query |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Bounded range, LINQ | 14,453.61 | 80.76 | 99.4% (179×) | 19,485,064 | 57,523 |
| Bounded range, SQL | 14,329.03 | 73.40 | 99.5% (195×) | 19,486,400 | 58,947 |

This case returns ten documents. The gain depends on how much of the original
one-sided scan the other bound excludes. Range and disjunction tests: 14 passed.

## 3. Prune contradictory scalar constraints

The optimizer proves incompatible equalities/ranges on scalar paths using the
active collation, then supplies an empty input to the normal query pipeline.
This works without an index and preserves empty aggregate/group/count behavior.
Bound parameters are checked on each execution, including separate Where calls.
Multikey predicates and computed field expressions are excluded from the proof.

| Complete query | Before µs | After µs | Time reduction | Before B/query | After B/query |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Indexed impossible range | 14,274.38 | 38.01 | 99.7% (376×) | 19,465,812 | 21,771 |
| Unindexed incompatible equalities | 30,508.36 | 40.57 | 99.9% (752×) | 38,640,520 | 19,971 |

The workloads are `Score > 10010 && Score < 10000` and
`Name == "Person1" && Name == "Person2"`. These are deliberately impossible
queries: this optimization helps generated predicates and does not promise a
speedup for satisfiable queries. Optimizer and vector regression tests: 268 passed,
one existing skip.

## 4. Automatically reuse ordinary LINQ shapes

A bounded cache owned by each mapper reuses compiled logical templates for
structurally equivalent LINQ expressions. The workloads construct ordinary LINQ
queries with changing captured values on every iteration; none calls `Bind`.
Each call reevaluates and serializes its current values. Metadata guards handle
mapper changes, and structural keys retain no captured objects. Tests cover
nested bindings, closures, getter evaluation order, mutable metadata, live custom
serializers, enum settings, concurrent callers, reentrancy, and bounded storage.

This smaller effect uses three processes per version (27 batches, interleaved
before/after/after/before/before/after) after finalizing the cache implementation.

| Complete ordinary LINQ query | Before µs | After µs | Time reduction | Before B/query | After B/query |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Primary-key lookup | 38.03 | 34.83 | 8.4% | 33,676 | 32,451 |
| Combined indexed predicate | 63.28 | 52.03 | 17.8% | 38,363 | 34,895 |
| Indexed filter plus projection, five rows | 98.37 | 85.31 | 13.3% | 50,835 | 46,641 |

These are warm repeated shapes, including fresh expression trees and closures;
first use still translates. Structural indexer arguments, synthetic enum/DbRef
bindings, invoked lambdas, and oversized/unsupported shapes retain the existing
direct path. Explicit `Bind` can avoid the structural lookup as well. This is a
broad incremental improvement; unlike the earlier plan changes, it does not
reduce how many documents a query reads. Full .NET 8 suite: 933 passed, seven
existing skips.

## 5. Simplify constant guards before planning

An optional filter such as `!enabled || row.Score == 1234`, with `enabled = true`,
previously hid the usable Score index behind an OR. The shared optimizer evaluates
safe constant/parameter Boolean guards and exposes the remaining predicate.
Both frontends benefit, and guards are evaluated again for each binding. Volatile
expressions stay in the filter; conditional immutability now correctly requires
all three operands to be immutable. Short circuits avoid unreachable expressions,
and a right-hand absorbing constant does not suppress evaluation of its left.

| Complete query | Before µs | After µs | Time reduction | Before B/query | After B/query |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Optional filter, LINQ | 29,195.13 | 38.57 | 99.9% (757×) | 40,873,992 | 32,744 |
| Optional filter, SQL | 29,685.81 | 53.43 | 99.8% (556×) | 40,882,336 | 39,766 |

This measures enabling a selective filter, which changes a full scan into one
seek. Disabling the filter intentionally returns all rows and still requires a
scan. Focused simplification tests: 18 passed, including outer current paths and
empty vector queries; expression/shared-IR checks also passed. Existing pipeline ordering already filters before sorting/projection and
defers unnecessary includes, so no duplicate ordering rewrite was added.

## 6. Intersect IN and BETWEEN constraints before selecting an index

The planner now combines scalar equality, IN, range, and BETWEEN constraints
before comparing index costs. It removes only filters enforced by the selected
scan. Intersections use the active collation and current parameter values;
ANY/ALL predicates remain separate. Internal volatility metadata also prevents
hoisting changing functions nested inside MAP or array expressions.

| Complete query | Before µs | After µs | Time reduction | Before B/query | After B/query |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| IN list plus range, SQL | 858,050.25 | 488.82 | 99.9% (1,755×) | 37,896,048 | 299,358 |
| Overlapping IN lists, SQL | 50,753.46 | 677.61 | 98.7% (75×) | 14,730,464 | 181,830 |
| Overlapping BETWEEN ranges, SQL | 33,332.30 | 81.42 | 99.8% (409×) | 41,543,632 | 60,278 |
| Combined Contains and range, LINQ | 976,855.58 | 966,851.26 | 1.0% | 42,244,816 | 42,244,760 |
| Primary-key lookup, control | 34.62 | 34.12 | 1.4% | 33,274 | 33,290 |
| Different-field predicate, control | 45.13 | 44.47 | 1.5% | 31,738 | 31,762 |

The IN workloads use 1,000 candidate keys and return eleven or six documents;
the BETWEEN workload returns ten. The combined LINQ workload exposes a separate
miss: a Boolean wrapper hides Contains from normalization, leaving its plan
unchanged at this step. Its small timing difference and the control differences
are not evidence of an improvement. SQL, string expressions, and LINQ with
separate Contains/range Where calls can use the new intersection.

Raw samples: `06-constraints-*`. All checksums match. Full .NET 8 and .NET 10
suites each pass 967 tests with seven existing skips; the Release solution builds.

## 7. Expose predicates inside Boolean identity comparisons

The optimizer removes Boolean identity comparisons such as `(predicate) = true`
and `(predicate) != false`. This exposes Contains when it appears inside an
ordinary LINQ conjunction, allowing the existing IN normalization and constraint
intersection to run. SQL uses the same rewrite. Changing Boolean parameters,
BSON type distinctions, short circuits, and negated comparisons retain their
semantics. ANY is now explicit node metadata; logical rewrites previously lost
it when its detection depended on generated expression text.

| Complete query | Before µs | After µs | Time reduction | Before B/query | After B/query |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Combined Contains and range, LINQ | 978,483.30 | 673.84 | 99.9% (1,452×) | 42,244,760 | 413,488 |
| Boolean-wrapped OR, SQL | 30,318.25 | 70.15 | 99.8% (432×) | 42,005,704 | 60,294 |
| Primary-key lookup, longer control | 37.90 | 35.94 | 5.2% | 33,290 | 33,290 |
| Different-field predicate, longer control | 49.54 | 47.44 | 4.2% | 31,762 | 31,762 |

The LINQ workload is the same case left unchanged by step 6, with a 1,000-key
candidate list and eleven returned documents. No API change or explicit Bind is
needed. Initial short control runs varied in both directions (including a 3.9%
slowdown for the point lookup), so the controls above use a fresh pair of runs
with ten times as many iterations per batch. Their allocations and plans are
unchanged; the timing variation does not establish a general speedup or regression.
All original short samples and the longer repeats are retained in `07-*`.

All checksums match within each comparison. Full .NET 8 suite: 981 passed, seven
existing skips. The Release solution builds all targets.

## Combined result and practical priority (steps 1–5)

A separate complete-suite comparison runs the post-IR baseline against all five
optimizations together. Two processes per version use the same 18-batch method;
all consumed-result checksums match. The raw `all-before-*` / `all-after-*` files
include the execution plans and every workload, not just the strongest cases.

| Complete query | Baseline µs | All changes µs | Time reduction |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Equality OR, LINQ | 29,784.99 | 49.20 | 99.8% |
| Optional filter, LINQ | 29,871.67 | 38.90 | 99.9% |
| Bounded range, LINQ | 14,545.73 | 69.32 | 99.5% |
| Impossible indexed range | 14,498.15 | 28.36 | 99.8% |
| Impossible unindexed equalities | 29,437.24 | 29.20 | 99.9% |
| Ordinary primary-key lookup | 39.73 | 37.69 | 5.1% |
| Ordinary combined predicate | 61.43 | 55.42 | 9.8% |
| Ordinary indexed projection | 101.75 | 90.40 | 11.2% |
| Full-scan control | 60,735.77 | 61,149.38 | -0.7% |

The full-scan control is effectively unchanged. Timings on this shared host vary,
so per-step percentages should not be multiplied together. The separate cache
measurements isolate its benefit; combined measurements also include the added
optimizer checks. Cold queries, disk-bound execution, and different selectivity
can have very different results.

The best practical return is avoiding unnecessary reads: indexed OR seeks,
bounded ranges, and simplifying optional guards. Contradiction pruning is cheap
but benefits impossible queries only. Automatic LINQ caching benefits repeated
ordinary shapes more broadly, with smaller gains. Further filter ordering would
need a cost model and purity rules; the pipeline already puts filters before
sorting and projection. A source generator, physical-plan cache, and specialized
materializers remain separate work.
