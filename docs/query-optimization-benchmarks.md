# Incremental query optimization measurements

These changes build on the shared query IR (`57a94728`). Each optimization has
its own commit, correctness tests, and before/after measurements against the
immediately preceding implementation. Ordinary LINQ and SQL use the query
optimizations automatically.

## Method

`tools/QueryOptimizationBenchmarks` runs complete queries on an in-memory database
of 20,000 documents, with indexes on `_id`, `Score`, and `City`. Every query fully
consumes and checksums its results. Database creation, inserts, indexing, and
warmup are outside timing. Each process records nine batches, elapsed time,
allocated bytes, Gen0 collections, and representative execution plans.

Measurements use production assemblies (`TestingEnabled=false`), .NET 8.0.30 on
Linux x64 / AMD Ryzen 9 3900X, pinned to CPU 2 with tiered compilation disabled.
Two processes per version run sequentially in before/after/after/before order;
tables pool their 18 samples and report medians. These are warm, memory-resident
workloads, not disk throughput claims. Raw data is in
[`benchmarks/query-optimization`](benchmarks/query-optimization).

Build each library revision to a separate output directory, then compile the
same harness against it:

```sh
dotnet build LiteDB/LiteDB.csproj -c Release -f net8.0 -p:TestingEnabled=false -o /tmp/opt-lib
dotnet build tools/QueryOptimizationBenchmarks -c Release -p:LiteDBAssembly=/tmp/opt-lib/LiteDB.dll -o /tmp/opt-bench
DOTNET_TieredCompilation=0 taskset -c 2 dotnet /tmp/opt-bench/QueryOptimizationBenchmarks.dll label or
python3 tools/QueryIrBenchmarks/compare.py --before before-1.json before-2.json --after after-1.json after-2.json
```

The optional final argument filters workload names by prefix; omit it to run
the full suite. The `or` prefix also includes the `ordinary-*` control queries.

## 1. Equality disjunctions use indexed seeks

`Score == 1234 || Score == 17890` previously scanned all 20,000 documents.
The optimizer recognizes equalities on the same scalar indexed expression and
executes the equivalent IN seeks. It supports nested OR, reversed operands,
parameters, and deterministic expression indexes. Mixed fields/operators and
multikey ANY/ALL predicates retain their existing behavior. Seek values are
ordered and deduplicated using the database collation, preserving index-based
sorting and pagination.

| Complete query | Before µs | After µs | Time reduction | Before B/query | After B/query |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| OR, LINQ | 31,276.40 | 64.82 | 99.8% (483×) | 40,879,384 | 54,254 |
| OR, SQL | 30,322.66 | 63.95 | 99.8% (474×) | 40,882,488 | 57,510 |
| Ordinary primary-key lookup, control | 41.68 | 40.62 | 2.5% | 33,652 | 33,676 |
| Ordinary combined predicate, control | 65.02 | 63.71 | 2.0% | 37,539 | 37,587 |

The large gain comes from replacing a full scan with two seeks. The control
queries have unchanged plans; their small timing differences are not evidence
of a general speedup. Focused disjunction, ordering, and shared-IR tests: 29 passed.

## 2. Intersect scalar index bounds

`Score >= 10000 && Score < 10010` previously scanned from 10000 through 20000,
loading documents to test the upper bound. The optimizer now intersects bounds
on the selected scalar index and removes the filters the bounded scan enforces.
Inclusive/exclusive endpoints, reversed comparisons, redundant bounds, separate
parameter documents, numeric types, and collation are preserved. ANY/ALL ranges
are excluded because separate elements may satisfy their bounds. Backtracking
at an inclusive range endpoint now also uses the database collation.

| Complete query | Before µs | After µs | Time reduction | Before B/query | After B/query |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Bounded range, LINQ | 14,453.61 | 80.76 | 99.4% (179×) | 19,485,064 | 57,523 |
| Bounded range, SQL | 14,329.03 | 73.40 | 99.5% (195×) | 19,486,400 | 58,947 |

This case returns ten documents. The gain depends on how much of the original
one-sided scan the other bound excludes. Range and disjunction tests: 14 passed.
